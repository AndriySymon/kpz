# Programming principles in my code
## 1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
My code is simple and clear. Each class and method has a clear purpose, which makes it easy to understand and modify the code. Also, every class is located in different files.
## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
My code is written in such a way that each piece of information in the system is unique and not repeated. For example, I use the [AddProduct](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Warehouse.cs#L18) methods in the [Warehouse](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Warehouse.cs) and [ShoppingCart](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/ShoppingCart.cs) classes to add products, instead of repeating this code in each class.
## 3. SOLID
 * Single Responsibility Principle: Each class in my code has a single responsibility. For example, the [Product](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs) class is only responsible for storing product information.
* Open/Closed Principle: My code is written in such a way that it can be easily extended without modifying the existing code. For example, I can add new product types without changing the [Warehouse](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Warehouse.cs) class.
* Liskov Substitution Principle: In my code, all derived classes can be replaced by their base classes without changing the correctness of the program.
* Interface Segregation Principle: Each class uses only the interfaces it needs. For example, the [Product](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs) class uses only the [IMoney](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/IMoneyInterface.cs) interface.
* Dependency Inversion Principle: My code depends on abstractions, not on specific details. For example, the [Product](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs) class depends on the [IMoney](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/IMoneyInterface.cs) abstraction, not on the specific [Money](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Money.cs) class.
## 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
I don't add functionality to my code until it's needed. This helps avoid unnecessary complexity and code. Also, the code does not contain unnecessary classes that are not used anywhere or unnecessary methods that do not provide functionality.
## 5. Composition Over Inheritance
I use composition instead of inheritance whenever possible. For example, the [Product](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs) class has [Money](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs#L12) and [Category](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs#L13) objects as part of its state, instead of inheriting from them.
## 6. Program to Interfaces not Implementations
I program to interfaces, not implementations. For example, the [Price](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs#L18) property in the [Product](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs) class is of type [IMoney](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/IMoneyInterface.cs), not the concrete [Money](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Money.cs) class.
## 7. Fail Fast
My code quickly detects errors and stops immediately. For example, the [ReducePrice](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs#L28) method in the [Product](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Product.cs) class throws an exception if you try to reduce the price by more than it is.
