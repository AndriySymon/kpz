# Programming principles in my code
## 1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
My code is simple and clear. Each class and method has a clear purpose, which makes it easy to understand and modify the code. Also, every class is located in different files.
## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
My code is written in such a way that each piece of information in the system is unique and not repeated. For example, I use the [AddProduct](https://github.com/AndriySymon/kpz/blob/master/lab-01/ClassLibrary/Warehouse.cs#L18) methods in the Warehouse and ShoppingCart classes to add products, instead of repeating this code in each class.
